# Low-Level Design (LLD) Checklist for Replies-Engine Components

This document provides a comprehensive checklist for creating Low-Level Design documents for each component of the replies-engine microservice. We will address these items for each component to ensure thorough planning before implementation.

## Development Sequence

We will create LLD documents for components in the following sequence (follows the flow of data):

1. **API Gateway (Webhook Endpoint)**
2. **IncomingWebhookHandler Lambda**
3. **SQS Queues (Whatsapp-Replies, Human-Handoff)**
4. **ReplyProcessorLambda**
5. **IAM Roles & Policies**
6. **CloudWatch Monitoring & Alerts**

## Next Steps

After completing the LLD documents for all components, we will:

1. Review all LLDs for consistency and completeness
2. Develop a thin end-to-end implementation
3. Test the implementation locally
4. Deploy manually via AWS CLI
5. Review and refine the implementation
6. Create AWS SAM template
7. Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
8. Implement comprehensive testing
9. Deploy to production

## First LLD Focus: API Gateway (Webhook Endpoint)

As the entry point for all incoming communication, our first LLD document will focus on the API Gateway webhook endpoint for Twilio WhatsApp messages. This component receives HTTP POST requests from Twilio when users reply to messages, validates the Twilio signature, and forwards the request to the IncomingWebhookHandler Lambda.
